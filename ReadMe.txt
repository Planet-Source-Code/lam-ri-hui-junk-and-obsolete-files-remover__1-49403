Junk and Obsolete Files Remover
By Lam Ri Hui (rihui@email.com)

Most of your Windows applications temporarily create several files on your hard drive when they are running.  These files are supposed to be removed and the space recovered after these programs are closed.  Often, however, they don’t because of a program error, sloppy architecture, your system is reset or not shut down properly, or if another application locks up or crashes.  Any file that is left behind in this manner will remain on your system unless you manually search for it and remove it.  Over time, these junk and obsolete files can accumulate to megabytes of wasted hard drive space, as well as turn into potential error-producing cross-linked drive references.

Junk and Obsolete Files Remover targets these specific types of files which are missed by common disk utilities, un-install, "Defrag", "Scandisk", and other standard "cleaner" type programs.

As well as wasting space on your system, obsolete and junk files can produce very hazardous results if not properly cleaned from your drive on a periodical basis.

The symptoms that these garbage files can produce include:


·	Cross-linked drive references

·	Lost network and Internet connections.

·	Sudden application lock ups.

·	Lost data

·	General Protection Faults (GPF’s) or Fatal Errors in your applications.

·	Virus like behavior

·	Mysterious Reboots

·	Out of Memory Errors
